# Simon-Game
This is an intermediate-level javascript project.
To build this project we need HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Let us take a look at how this game works. Initially, we display a start screen. The player clicks on the start button to get the game started. The game lights up colours in a particular sequence. The player has to memorize the sequence and click the colours in the exact sequence.
If he is successful in doing so he moves to the next level where the count of the sequence is increased by 1. However, if the player fails to play the right sequence he loses and we display the count as a score and show the ‘Play Again’ button.
